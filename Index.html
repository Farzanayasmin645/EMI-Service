            <p>
                Health is the most important asset that one has, and it deserves the utmost protection and care.
                Medical-related emergencies can occur at any time, and the last thing you want to worry about is how to
                pay for your care. That's where medical loans can be useful. Medical loans are unsecured personal loans
                that you can avail to cover sudden and unforeseen medical expenses. These expenses can include hospital
                bills, prescription bills, surgery costs, chemotherapy costs, etc. Moreover, a medical emergency loan
                can ensure that you receive the best treatment possible and clear out all bills in case of a cash
                crunch.(Kotak Mahindra Bank, 2022). For immediate cases patients' family members will get some other
                benefit for the EMI system. Such as, a medical emergency loan does not require you to provide collateral
                to approve your loan. Also, process without hassles or stress.

            </p>
            <p>
                In Addition, you can choose an Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) that is affordable for you because a
                medical loan has a flexible repayment period. Simply use an EMI calculator for a personal loan to
                determine how much you can afford to pay each month. Based on the necessary loan amount, this tool will
                assist you in calculating your monthly payment. For example, EMI from a hospital is offered on condition
                to their client, you have to repay that money with a very small amount of internet. Suppose, if you take
                1 lakh money from the hospital you have to repay within how many months you can decide by yourself and
                pay it back by every month. Including this money you also have to give very little percentage interest
                to the hospital. (Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) Definition, 2021).

            </p>
            <p>
                In our Bangladesh if we see then we will find lots of poor people dying because they don't have money
                for their treatment. Sometimes rich people are also suffering the same problems because for treatment
                purposes sometimes in an emergency operation rich people have some cash by any way and that time they
                have to manage leftover money that within one hour sometimes it is not possible to manage,So if from
                hospital they get this help then it will anyhow save a life.
                Therefore, EMI systems help people significantly if there is an emergency.

            <h3>Build Myself as Web-Developer</h3>
            <p>
                If Bangladeshi peoples will start getting EMI system because of this EMI base website from hospital then
                people without dying percentage will be reduced and people will work hard for earn money. Also, men and
                women both will work to treat themselves and earn money to repay the EMI. That's how they will save
                their life from the disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, having no money, especially the poor people are day by day living life with a small disease.
                They don't have money for medicine and treatment. So, they ignore their illness this way and when they
                realize their condition is now getting worse , they go to the government hospital and take general
                treatment because they do not have money. If EMI website service this facilities to the people than poor
                people first time visit to the hospital and took good treatment than after they will be fine, they will
                do something and repayment the money to the hospital by EMI system.
