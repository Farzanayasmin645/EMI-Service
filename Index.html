                Health is the most important asset that one has, and it deserves the utmost protection and care.
                Medical-related emergencies can occur at any time, and the last thing you want to worry about is how to
                pay for your care. That's where medical loans can be useful. Medical loans are unsecured personal loans
                that you can avail to cover sudden and unforeseen medical expenses. These expenses can include hospital
                bills, prescription bills, surgery costs, chemotherapy costs, etc. Moreover, a medical emergency loan
                can ensure that you receive the best treatment possible and clear out all bills in case of a cash
                crunch.(Kotak Mahindra Bank, 2022).

            <h3>Build Myself as Web-Developer</h3>
            <p>
                If Bangladeshi peoples will start getting EMI system because of this EMI base website from hospital then
                people without dying percentage will be reduced and people will work hard for earn money. Also, men and
                women both will work to treat themselves and earn money to repay the EMI. That's how they will save
                their life from the disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, having no money, especially the poor people are day by day living life with a small disease.
                They don't have money for medicine and treatment. So, they ignore their illness this way and when they
                realize their condition is now getting worse , they go to the government hospital and take general
                treatment because they do not have money. If EMI website service this facilities to the people than poor
                people first time visit to the hospital and took good treatment than after they will be fine, they will
                do something and repayment the money to the hospital by EMI system.
